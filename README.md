# Rehabilitation tool for strengthening the shoulder girdle and memory in response to sports injuries

I chose as a final project to challenge myself and realize the project in a language that is still C # - I have not learned
 Because I knew that there would be great importance to an experiential and comfortable design, I chose to use a harmonious integration of a user interface alongside WPF software in technology.
Also in this project I worked in a team of three and learned about the ability of my conduct
.As part of a commandment
I chose my final project to implement a rehabilitation tool
In order to make the game more experiential and the project more interesting that mi KINECT programmatically I chose to incorporate the camera in the project
In the first step I examined the calibration capabilities of the camera and the functionality it enables
After that, I consulted with a rehabilitation specialist who recommended that I focus on rehabilitating the shoulder girdle whose need for strengthening is common among many people
And there is a tendency to get injured in them
I built a Simon game I experienced in which the user has to choose with the help of the camera
In this game the user learns to use the camera while practicing memory and palm muscles
 This exercise served me as a prototype for the main rehabilitation tool - "JUST MOVE"
 In it the user has to grasp objects that are on the screen while activating four movements of the shoulder muscles
The game offers several levels of difficulty with the differences between them being mainly the speed and time. We examined the final product among children and adults and witnessed their curiosity and desire to experience it
 The tool can be expanded for practicing additional movements and varied games
